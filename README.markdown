# This is my .vimrc

I'm usually working with Python/Django and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so my Vim IDE is configured for these languages.

All of the plugins are installed and updated via [Vundle plugin manager](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle)!

Have fun and fork at will! :)

# Quick start

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/oryband/dotvim.git ~/.vim` - *Be careful not to override your own configuration...*
2. Initialize the [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) plugin as a sub-repository:

        git submodule init
        git submodule update

3. Open vim and type `:BundleInstall!` to install all the plugins.
4. The rest is fully commented and explained in the `.virmc` file itself.

# Notes

1. To add JavaScript tag listing, add the .ctags file from my [dotfiles](http://github.com/oryband/dotfiles) repository to your home folder.
