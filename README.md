## About

This is my .vimrc.

I'm usually working with Python/Django and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so everything is configured to work with these languages.

All of the plugins are installed via [Vundle plugin manager](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for easy installation!

Have fun and fork at will! :)

## Quick start

1. Just open vim and type `:BundleInstall!` to install all the plugins.
2. The rest is fully commented and explained in the `.virmc` file itself.
