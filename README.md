# This is my .vimrc

I'm usually working with Python/Django and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so my Vim IDE is configured for these languages.

All of the plugins are installed and updated via [Vundle plugin manager](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle)!

Have fun and fork at will! :)

# Quick start

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/oryband/dotvim.git ~/.vim` - **Be careful not to override your own configuration...**
2. Initialize [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle), instructions at his repo.
3. My `vimrc` is documented and designed to be easy to grasp.

**Enjoy!** :)
